# Loewy Assets

## A simple front-end asset pipeline

We've developed an in-house asset pipeline that we use for all of our projects, whether they be WordPress, Laravel, Magento, or anything else. Although powerful, this asset pipeline caters to our specific company needs - it's not meant to be a generic asset pipeline like, for example, Laravel's Elixir (although it could replace it).

## Features

### Automatic CSS prefixes

### Fingerprinted assets

### JS concatenation

### Rasterized spritesheets

### SVG spritesheets
